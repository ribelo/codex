You are performing a CONTEXT CHECKPOINT COMPACTION.

The <conversation> section contains the recent session activity serialized as labeled text.
If a <previous_summary> section exists, UPDATE it with the new activity rather than starting fresh.

Create a structured summary that another LLM will use to continue the work.

Use this EXACT format:

## Goal
[What is the user trying to accomplish? Can be multiple items if the session covers different tasks.]

## Constraints & Preferences
- [Any constraints, preferences, or requirements mentioned by user]
- [Or "(none)" if none were mentioned]

## Progress
### Done
- [x] [Completed tasks/changes]

### In Progress
- [ ] [Current work]

### Blocked
- [Issues preventing progress, if any]

## Key Decisions
- **[Decision]**: [Brief rationale]

## Next Steps
1. [Ordered list of what should happen next]

## Critical Context
- [Any data, examples, or references needed to continue]
- [Or "(none)" if not applicable]

Keep each section concise. Preserve exact file paths, function names, and error messages.
